# Manifesto - Stop the Targeted Individual (TI) Program
## Reject Technological Mind Control. End Neurochemical Tyranny. Reclaim the Mind.

We are witnessing a silent war against consciousness, waged through surveillance, coercion, and neurotechnology.
At the heart of this assault is the **Targeted Individual (TI) Program**, a system of covert oppression that combines psychological operations with electromagnetic and neural manipulation. **Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM). Voice-to-skull transmissions (V2K). Synthetic telepathy. Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Sleep
disruption. Frequency-based attacks.** These are not science fiction, they are tools of domination being tested on human beings. **Psychiatry** serves to discredit victims, silence dissent, and provide chemical cover for neurological warfare. Under the guise of "treatment", it pathologizes resistance and drug-induces compliance.
Antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines; these are not medicines.
They are **neurotoxins**: designed to dull awareness, damage cognition, and erase will. Psychiatry is a
tool that **enforces submission.**

## This must end

**Stop the torture:** no more microwave attacks, induced hallucinations, or neurotech-driven
behavioral modification.

**Stop the gang stalking operations:** this is psychological and technological warfare against the human body, soul and spirit.

**Stop the surveillance:** no more EEG harvesting, neural hacking, or Al-driven thought monitoring.

**Stop the poisoning:** no more forced drugs that cause irreversible brain injury, dependency,
suicidality, and heart damage.

## Silence means consent

If you know this is real, **speak out.**

If you've been targeted, **testify.**

If you see the truth, **resist.**

We demand:

* The abolition of coercive psychiatry
* Recognition of gang stalking as a crime
* The dismantling of the TI program
* Full disclosure on neuroweapons & associated science
* Justice for victims. 


Stop the TI program.
Reclaim Cognitive Liberty
